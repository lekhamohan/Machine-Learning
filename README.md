 This is an implementation of Convolution Neural Network (CNN) to classify hand written digits of MNIST data. 
 The CNN model used here is LeNet, that been successfully able to classify hand written digits.LeNet is
composed of convolution layers and pooling layers, followed by an inner product layer and a loss layer.
